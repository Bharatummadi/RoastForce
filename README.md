# 🔥 Roastforce

Roastforce is a Chrome extension for Salesforce that calls you out when you save a field without a description, because “I’ll remember what this does” is a lie we all tell ourselves.

- It doesn’t block saves.  
- It doesn’t enforce rules.  
- It just shows up at the exact moment bad metadata decisions are made.

This is a nudge, not a gatekeeper.

## Why this exists

Documentation doesn’t fail because people don’t care.  
It fails because momentum wins.

Roastforce interrupts that momentum intentionally without blocking you.

## Note

This extension uses humor as a behavioral nudge. If you’re comfortable leaving future you confused, this may feel.......personal :)
